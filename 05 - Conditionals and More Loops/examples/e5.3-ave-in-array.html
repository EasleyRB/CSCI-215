        Does the Array include the average of all values?

        Write the following program using JavaScript:

            1. Prompt user to enter a series of numeric values separated by comma (see below).
            2. Determine if the average of the numbers is included as one of the numbers.
            3. Note: only use whole numbers.

        Example #1:
        Input: 28,5,27,69,4,8,59
        Output: The average value 28 is included in the list of values 28,5,27,69,4,8,59.

        Example #2:
        Input: 39,34,56,21,18,3,99
        Output: The average value 38 is not included in the list of values 39,34,56,21,18,3,99.

    // input
    let input = prompt("Input series of numbers separated by a comma: ");
    const numberArray = input.split(",");
    let sum = 0;
    let acc = 0;

    // calculations
    for (let i = 0; i<numberArray.length; i++)
    {
        sum += Number(numberArray[i]);
        acc ++;
    }

    let ave = parseInt(sum / acc);
    let isFound = false;
    for (let j = 0; j<numberArray.length; j++)
    {
        if (numberArray[j] == ave)
        {
            isFound = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    // output
    if (isFound == true)
    {
        document.write(`The average value ${ave} IS included in the list of values ${numberArray}.`);
    }
    else
    {
        document.write(`The average value ${ave} is not NOT included in the list of values ${numberArray}.`)
    }
